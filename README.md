Hi, my name is Aria and welcome to my data analytics portfolio! I have a bachelor's degree in agrotechnology so I'm no stranger to pulling insights from data and doing analysis. In addition to that, I've also completed a full-stack web bootcamp which allows me to learn tech skills such as python and SQL, which are important in data analytics role, more easily. I also have almost 3 years of experience handling multiple data dashboards from multiple sources and having to extract all the important information from it starting from data cleaning, data exploration using pivot tables and charts, to creating dashboards or discussing about the findings.

In here you will find some of my projects using SQL and python to process datasets found on the internet. Feel free to reach out to me on my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ariafikri/)!
